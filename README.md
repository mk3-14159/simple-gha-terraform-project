# Automate Terraform with GitHub Actions


This repo is a companion repo to the [Automate Terraform with GitHub Actions](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/github-actions?in=terraform/automation).

Couldn't get GH Actions to push to AWS EC2 Instance

Error Message on Terraform Apply

```
Error: creating EC2 Instance: Blocked: This account is currently blocked and not recognized as a valid account. Please contact aws-verification@amazon.com if you have questions.

```

My guess is that I have missed a verfication step either on AWS or Github
